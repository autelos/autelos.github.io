<p>... a soundscape is not simply a sum of all these sounds; rather it is a particular subset filtered through the context of a given environmental condition (Swift 6)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>why?</h2>
<p>this is essentially what i'm interested in attempting to capture - soundscapes of a "genuine but ephemeral set of circumstances existing in a precise moment of time," rather than soundscapes "meticulously fabricated and controlled in the vacuum of an audio editor". A.k.a field recording. Swift describes this further:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Field recording's authenticity is derived from a genuine but ephemeral set of circumstances existing in a precise moment of time, whereas the contrived scenario is fabricated, developed, and controlled in the vacuum of an audio editor. (Swift 7)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ironically, wishing to capture these events often blocks or these events from occurring. This could be an example of the observer effect, a "common phenomenon where the act of observation can alter the situation being observed." (Swift 3) I hypothesize that the wish and thought to record takes valuable attention away from the state of flow, and it requires some time again to get back into it. A common occurence in my own daily life: autotelic free play on an instrument -&gt; maybe a moment, groove, emerges - nice! i'd like to capture this! -&gt; stop playing, set up recorder, try to find it again, takes some time, energy is different, distracted, and recording captures this difference and distraction, not the original moment of free play and discovery.</p>
<p>Considering this, several strategies have been considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>a recorder ready to start at the click of a button</li>
<li>a recorder always running</li>
<li>a buffer recorder (capturing the last x-seconds)</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, these still require a bit of forethought that seems to block the moments from occurring. Whereas the moments happen seemingly unexpectedly/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of recording continuously, it selectively records excerpts from a location. These recordings—representing actual events from a specific time and place—can convey both a moment’s explicit actuality and serendipitous fragility. (Swift 8)</p>
<p>Acoustic Ecology, the study of human interactions to sounds in an environment; and Psychoacoustics, the study of perceptions and reactions to sound (“What is soundscape ecology?” 1215)</p>
<p>One of [Bernie Krause's, "Bernie Krause is one such musician and audio engineer who became interested in recording sounds of nature. He is currently one of the prominent leaders in the field of Soundscape Ecology with over 40 years of experience recording soundscapes. His work bridges the scientific and artistic communities being published both in academic journals and on commercial record labels."] tenets is that sounds should experienced in the context of their environment rather than attempting to isolate the sound. (Swift 10)</p>
